Revision history for Perl extension Class::Trait.

0.06 Nov. 15, 2005
    - Renamed "is" method to "does".  This is the same method name used with
      Perl 6 roles and avoids conflicts with Test::More::is().
        - &is is now offically deprecated, it will be removed after a few 
          more releases
        - Thanks to Curtis "Ovid" Poe for this code change

0.05 Sept. 14, 2005
    - fixed a bug in TEquality::isExactly
    - fixed Class::Trait::Reflection, it was loading Class::Trait
      in the wrong way
    - fixed path handling for Class::Trait, now uses File::Spec to
      create cross platform paths.
    - fixed the loading of traits with :: in them, this used to fail
           use Class::Trait qw(My::Trait);
      it works now. Thanks to Yuval Kogman <nothingmuch@woobling.org>
      for finding the issue.
    - SUPER:: handling now dispatches properly. Thanks to 
      Roman Daniel for the code and tests.

0.04 May 24, 2004
    - Added a default Trait Library which for now only contains 
      3 traits; TEquality, TComparable, TPrintable. See their
      documentation for more details on them. If these names are
      given, they are loaded from the trait's library.

0.03  Wed April 28th 2004
    - made this workable with mod_perl and reduced dependence on
      the INIT block. I am not 100% happy with it yet though, so 
      there will be further changes coming.

0.02  Mon April 19th 2004
    - Made "is" method search depth first down the Trait tree
      instead of just checking the top level trait and subtraits.
    - Spruced up the test suite alot, adding about 121 new tests.
    - Cleaned up some documentation issues. And updated anything 
      that needed it.
