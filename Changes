Revision history for Perl extension Class::Trait.

0.04 May 24, 2004
    - Added a default Trait Library which for now only contains 
      3 traits; TEquality, TComparable, TPrintable. See their
      documentation for more details on them. If these names are
      given, they are loaded from the trait's library.

0.03  Wed April 28th 2004
    - made this workable with mod_perl and reduced dependence on
      the INIT block. I am not 100% happy with it yet though, so 
      there will be further changes coming.

0.02  Mon April 19th 2004
    - Made "is" method search depth first down the Trait tree
      instead of just checking the top level trait and subtraits.
    - Spruced up the test suite alot, adding about 121 new tests.
    - Cleaned up some documentation issues. And updated anything 
      that needed it.
